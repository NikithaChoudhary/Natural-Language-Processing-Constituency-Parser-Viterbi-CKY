# Natural-Language-Processing-Constituency-Parser-using-Viterbi-CKY
Built the program that learns the probabilistic Context Free Grammar from an input file which contains tagged trees for the sentence.  
And Implemented a Viterbi parser that takes the grammar and sentence as input and outputs the highest-probability parse.
